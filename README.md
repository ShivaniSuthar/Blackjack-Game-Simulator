# Blackjack-Game-Simulator
## Project Summary:
I programmed the classic Blackjack casino card game including steps from shuffling a deck of cards to playing against the dealer and determining the winner. The program allows a player to play their  “hand” against the dealer’s hand and the program automatically determines whether the player should “hit” or  “stay”. 

The “card-” file contains the Card class which creates the cards needed to play the game. The “deck-” file contains the Deck class which creates a deck of 52 cards. The “shuffle-” file contains the shuffle class which includes two different methods of shuffling the cards. The “hand-” file contains the Playhand and Dealerhand classes which create a hand for the player and a hand for the dealer according to the Blackjack rules. The “blackjack-” file actually simulates a game of Blackjack and includes methods such as starting a round of Blackjack, determining if the player should “stand” or “hit”, calculating the score, and determining the winner. It also contains methods which create a log to track the results of the rounds. 

Multiple class construction, inheritance, and recursion were important concepts utilized in this project.

Doctests were used for testing/debugging.
